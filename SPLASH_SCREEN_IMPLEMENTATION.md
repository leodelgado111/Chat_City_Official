## Files Modified/Created

1. `app/src/main/java/com/chatcityofficial/chatmapapp/SplashActivity.kt` - Enhanced with animations
2. `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_splash.xml` - Created layout file
3. `app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml` - Added splash screen colors
4. `app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml` - Updated splash screen theme
5. `app/src/main/res/drawable/splash_background.xml` - Gradient background
6. `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Already configured correctly

## Testing Instructions

1. Build and run the app
2. The splash screen should appear immediately on launch
3. Watch the animations play out over 3 seconds
4. App should automatically transition to MainActivity

## Customization Options

You can easily customize:
- Animation durations in `SplashActivity.kt`
- Gradient colors in `colors.xml`
- Text content in `activity_splash.xml`
- Splash duration (currently 3000ms)

## Notes
- The splash screen uses the existing `chat_city_logo.xml` from the drawable folder
- The implementation follows Android best practices for splash screens
- All animations are hardware-accelerated for smooth performance
