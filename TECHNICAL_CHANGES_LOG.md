  - Gestures: Pan and pinch-to-zoom enabled, rotation disabled
  - Location updates: 10-second intervals with HIGH_ACCURACY priority
  - Geocoding: Fallback chain (locality > subAdminArea > adminArea)
  
- **Build Configuration**:
  - Kotlin with Gradle Kotlin DSL
  - Firebase integration (Firestore, Auth, Storage)
  - Google Services (Places API, Maps, Location)
  - Networking: OkHttp, Retrofit, WebSocket support

## Notes Section

### Important Reminders
- Always add new entries at the bottom
- Never delete or modify existing entries
- If you need to correct an entry, add a new entry with the correction
- Include enough detail that someone could understand the change without looking at the code
- For security-related changes, be careful not to expose sensitive information

### Categories Guide
- **Feature**: New functionality added
- **Bug Fix**: Correction of defects
- **Refactor**: Code improvements without changing functionality
- **Configuration**: Build, dependency, or environment changes
- **Documentation**: README, comments, or documentation updates
- **Security**: Security improvements or vulnerability fixes
- **Performance**: Optimization and performance improvements
- **UI**: User interface changes
- **UX**: User experience improvements

### Future Considerations
- Consider adding automated tooling to enforce append-only policy
- May want to add tags or labels for easier searching
- Consider splitting into yearly files if log becomes too large
- Add integration with CI/CD to auto-generate entries for certain changes
