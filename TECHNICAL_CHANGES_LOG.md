**Technical Details**: 
Current Implementation Status:
- **Navigation System**: Custom navigation bar with animated outline (100ms ValueAnimator)

  - Gestures: Pan and pinch-to-zoom enabled, rotation disabled
  - Location updates: 10-second intervals with HIGH_ACCURACY priority
  - Geocoding: Fallback chain (locality > subAdminArea > adminArea)
  
- **Build Configuration**:
  - Kotlin with Gradle Kotlin DSL
  - Firebase integration (Firestore, Auth, Storage)
  - Google Services (Places API, Maps, Location)
  - Networking: OkHttp, Retrofit, WebSocket support

### 2025-01-23 21:35 - Claude/Assistant
**Category**: UI
**Files Modified**: app/src/main/java/com/chatcityofficial/chatmapapp/ui/home/HomeFragment.kt
**Description**: Disabled Mapbox scale bar (mile-radius indicator) to provide cleaner map interface
**Technical Details**: 
- Added import for `com.mapbox.maps.plugin.scalebar.scalebar`
- Added `mapView.scalebar.enabled = false` in the `initializeMap()` function
- This is set right after disabling the location component and before gesture configuration
- The scale bar (showing distance/radius measurements like "200 ft" or "1 mi") will no longer appear on the map
- Code snippet:
```kotlin
// CRITICAL: Disable the scale bar (mile-radius bar) completely
mapView.scalebar.enabled = false
```
**Breaking Changes**: No
**Testing Notes**: 
1. Launch the app and navigate to the Home screen with the map
2. Verify that no scale bar appears in any corner of the map
3. Test at different zoom levels - the scale bar should never appear
4. Pinch to zoom in/out and pan around - scale bar should remain hidden
**Related Issues/PRs**: N/A

### 2025-01-23 21:54 - Claude/Assistant
**Category**: Bug Fix
**Files Modified**: app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml
**Description**: Fixed duplicate theme definition build error
**Technical Details**: 
- Removed duplicate `Theme.ChatCityOfficial` definition from themes.xml
- The theme was defined in both styles.xml and themes.xml causing a resource merger conflict
- Kept the more complete definition in styles.xml which includes all related styles
- themes.xml now only contains the `Theme.SplashScreen` style
- Build error was: "Duplicate resources: [style/Theme.ChatCityOfficial]"
**Breaking Changes**: No
**Testing Notes**: 
1. Run `./gradlew clean` to clear build cache
2. Run `./gradlew assembleDebug` - build should complete successfully
3. Verify app launches normally with correct theming
**Related Issues/PRs**: N/A
